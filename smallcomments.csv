I take five classes in school instead of six classes. My mom said that she wanted me to get straight A's not B's. I feel like my grade will drop somewhere this weekend. Why? Cause for my English quiz I don't think I got an A. But I thinking  I did pass it but I probably got a B and C. It probably might drop my grade to a B or lower. Second, We'll first last week I wasn't at school. And my teacher did the food inc project. I'm afraid he'll put a zero on my grade book cause he probably forget that I wasn't there in class. I scared to tell my teacher even though he's a nice person. But I don't why I'm shy or so to talk to him. Third, I didn't finish doing my multimedia project. Plus my mom said if I'm not read for a written test she won't let me go anywhere for fun or let me buy Starbucks. Well Starbucks makes me happy the most. Cause coffee makes me excited. Also dmv test is hard and I'm stress out to study. My parents won't study for me cause obviously it's my own study concept. If you tell me to cope with stuff or deal with it then I'm gonna run away from home forever cause I'm not gonna sit here every freaking day and feel bored and deal with a stuff. Also I'm not gonna sit here all day  when my mom kept yelling at me or complaining  to me that I don't get straight A's. Also I wanted to pursue to be an Actress and Singer one day but it's not gonna happen. I felt like celebrities don't care for other people's feelings like me that I got rejected for auditions and stuff. My dad said that if it's the struggle to become one then he won't let me pursue my dreams. He want me to stop my dreams forever. I don't want to do acting or singing for a hobby. I want to do acting and singing for a career. I know it's hard to make a living for it but I felt like I'm gonna be rejected all the time. My dad said I'm not ready to audition and I'm sad plus I don't like my voice lesson school anymore. I love acting, singing, and youtubing. I don't want to deal with things anymore. I want to run away from home if my grades aren't straight A's and I'll go somewhere very far away. I'll just sit there and have starvation and die already.",2017-09-09T05:33:50+0000

I DM'D her the first time and we talked and she thanked me for caring, but early yesterday she posted a throwaway video on Instagram  (with Pooh and Piglet) about wishing for death and retweeted her 'not wanting to exist anymore' tweet. She hasn't been on social media as far as I can tell since those contacts. I've tried to contact her in dm's and through  some people she kind of knows, to no avail, asking her just to post something so I'd know she was ok, and still nothing.

He was getting ready to go gas himself in his truck with a hose in the exhaust. He has been going through a bad breakup with the mother of his daughter and things came to a very bad escalation point. She talked him into seeking help by leading him to believe they could have a chance again, but I don't believe this is what she really wants as her actions speak otherwise. I am very worried for his safety in the very near future. 
But here is a bigger question. If someone is in so much pain throughout their whole life, has been in and out of Doctor's offices and psych wards and on and off of meds, tries to cope everyday but just can't do it, can't bear to live another day in their excruciating existence, can't take the fighting and the drama and the crushing weight of the world anymore, is it wrong to force someone into a locked ward ""for their own good"" because we are too selfish about how we would feel to have him end his life on his own terms when he finally comes to the realization that this is all too much to handle anymore and he is tired of running on a treadmill to nowhere? Is it his fault for wanting to die, or is it our fault for not wanting them to go? I always have maintained that I just want him to be happy and not have these feelings anymore. I want him to not be burdened by the depression or the anxiety or the fear. But what if that never happens. What if this trip to the psych ward doesn't help again? What if they can't stop what his mind is telling him? What if he again reaches the decision that the only way to stop the madness is to end his life? It it right to take that decision away from him and lock him up and ""keep him safe"" because we are too selfish to be able to let him go? We never want anyone to die, ever. When my grandma was in the hospital after falling again at 84 and injuring her hip for the second time, we didn't want her to die. She was skin and bones, moaning in pain with a fentynol patch on each skinny arm, and the Dr. said all they could really do was keep her comfortable. My grandma had a DNR order. She did not want to be kept alive in that situation. None of us wanted for her to have to leave us but it was the only way for her pain to end. What if sometimes the only way for someone to finally have peace is to let them go and know that the time we shared with them is special? Where is the line between free will and control of your destiny, and controlling another person's life because you may not like the outcome?",2017-09-07T19:38:38+0000

Hey my name is Courtney Bailey from Pineywoods Al , I lost a cousin that was raised as my brother on July 25th 2017 to suicide at the young age of 22.  He suffered severe depression. I'm trying to raise awareness. There's not 1 person that deserves to feel worthless, I would like to promote suicide awareness I want everyone suffering to know it's not the end they are not alone. Sawyer Bailey took on many burdens including some of my own and I feel I owe him this much. Make him your hero because he is mine.

I see their side-glances of ""oh shit what is that"" or their looks of confusion. (I would rather them just straight out ask me rather than blatantly staring). 

I actually went to the dermatologist for prescription-strength scar fade cream and him and his staff gave me the most disgusting response. Basically the nurse had to leave the room because she couldn't stand the sight of my scars and the reason why I was there. My doctor then proceeded to lecture me on god and how he didn't understand what I was doing to myself. This is why there is a stigma and this is why people are so hesitant to talk about it, because of experiences like these. I told him why and explained everything and that if he had more questions he could go read an article on Psychology Today. 

That being said, I just put cover-up on them now and don't go to that doctor anymore lol. It's a part of my life I'm not particularly proud of, but we all have moments like those. Just gotta keep going and keep fighting because it's just not worth it.",2017-08-15T14:54:03+0000

I remember throughout my years every occasion that someone I knew (or even a total stranger in a store aisle) looked at the scars on my arm and said, ""What happened there?"" And then everyone else turn to look as well, and now you're faced with that incredibly uncomfortable moment of feeling embarrassed, ashamed, frustrated that they would ask that...and you have to decide do I lie and tell them, ""Nothing happened."" or ""I broke up a cat fight."" to save their comfort or do I tell them, ""I had a bad relapse and cut myself open and ended up in the hospital."" ? It's not a pleasant situation to have that thrown at you unexpectedly and have people pry into something so personal without really wanting to know what happened. I wish people would think a bit before saying something, and least of all, not by thrusting you in the spotlight unannounced.
Hopefully articles like this can spread awareness, and given time, help people to tread more gently when noticing and discussing one's scars. Many are a result of a suicide attempt (s), and to bring that up out with such casualness can be upsetting. It's not always easy to discuss that, usually it's never easy. So tread softly.

I personally do not hide my scars or make any attempt. I don't feel a want to hide them nor do I feel I should hide them to spare other people whatever discomfort they might feel. If what I went through upsets them, not to be rude, but that's their problem. Don't make it mine, please.

I see people notice my scars, I see their eyes, their stares, I notice when they notice. I also notice other people's scars but I make a point to never stare or linger. I see it and I know what it is and my heart instantly goes out to them. I don't know if their battle is done, or if it ever will be, but I see them alive and in the world for another day and I feel it's a small victory.  And in a weird way, it gives me a bit of hope when I see other people with scars, because they've made it so far and so have I and we're still here. We're all still here despite the scars. :)",2017-08-15T07:50:41+0000

Being someone who struggled with this for years though, I can empathize with this and do agree with the vast majority of this.

I work in a very social environment and by this point, any time some guy tries to romanticize it, I want nothing more than to roll my eyes so far back into my head that they end up in another dimension. When people ask, I simply tell them it's old news.

""Professional"" help only cares depending on your health insurance coverage. Sitting with a therapist while they crack you open and spill those emotions from you only to say that'll be $150 when your 45 minutes are up isn't the most caring & satisfying feeling. You're alone while they're on vacation with the money they made from the suffering. 

Learn to walk it alone. Retrain your brain. There is no one out there that will ever care more about you then you. Its not easy, its never easy. 

What is easy is getting stuck in the endless loop of thinking someone is out there who truly cares without any gain or benefit to themselves. Maybe those people do exist but while your trying to find that person, you suffer and the clock ticks away. Before you know it two decades have gone by and you haven't healed and you're still alone. 

The real battle comes from making that ok in your own brain. Making only yourself enough to be happy. Happiness may never find you. It hasnt for me. I may never find it and die one day never truly feeling happy or going a day witbout sadness. But its never easy.",2017-08-16T13:25:34+0000

At times i was okay and thought i can go out and abiut in the community l live at...one day l went out to luch with a my life long friend; wr got to the deli and there were 3 people i knew, they said hello to me and next i went from being okay to anxiety inside myself. I responded within me...oh my shaking inside and went tp say hi and hugged them. I caught up to my friend and said....""l have to go back to the truck."" I can't be here. Having a moment of fear, the 3 people o seen was 3 people too many. I was shaking and went right back out and had to calm myself.
 The sharing is that i can be alright then in an instant not alright. That is my unexpected anxiety moment. Do not know why that happened. I felr safe on the truck again away from all. My friend csme back with our lunch and helped me by just listening to me. We eent for a ride. 
That is my share on my anxiety visit. If i feel i can't go out anf about in my small community then i stay in until o feel ready. This moment was mid of last year.
 Since i am doing okay. It is a scary place tp be especially since   our community is a pop.1200. Anxiety is a deep inner dark place it can be sneaky/unexpected Energy twirling inside me. It was shared to me to do jumping jacks or If i can EFT TO Lessen it as much or little as i can. Even knowing that in my calm self... ehen anxiety appears that information disappears. 
Getting thru it is relief.
I have Been doing okay these days. Thank you for this.",2017-05-31T06:29:24+0000

It's hard, knowing people will judge, and asking prodding questions, or questions that feel like prodding. I have had people judge because of it, say I am looking for attention, I'm being selfish, or whatever. In part, they are somewhat correct, but it is not the attention they think. I seek to draw attention to the disorder, for more understanding and empathetic attitudes towards it, not just for me, but for all others who suffer.

Who could understand and share knowledge about it better than someone who goes through it? So I have to share it. And even though it does bring me some anxiety to do so, I know it's for the better in the long run.",2017-05-31T01:30:08+0000

I got so down after my mom and the constant abuse I was in such a dark place and so much pain not just physically but mentally. It is literally hell having to fight your own self. I was depressed beyond any other time ever I had been depressed. I truely tho that was my only way out of the hell. I tho my kids would be so much better off without me and seeing what was going on. I thought I had no other choice. I made a call that truely saved my life. They gave me the words and strength I needed to get out of my situation and made my life better and my kids aswell. If you have never been in that dark of a hole please never judge. You don't know what hell someone is going thru! Mental illness needs to be addressed more. People are truely suffering and nobody helps. Most people are suffering alone bc they don't have medical insurance to get the help they need. Don't judge what you don't know. I hope one day people will truely see this is a problem just like cancer etc is. It has no limit who it effects. It's just not the poor or rich or black or white etc. this can happen to anyone we live and know. So please don't be so quick to judge.

If they really thought about what deep, inconsolable pain it causes others then maybe it would be a reprieve, especially the why with never closure or a satisfactory answer. That's why we have to reach out to others. I think the people who succeed in this tragic final act have thought about it for awhile. Not all, but most.

But I have never wanted to hurt anybody, in fact I've fought it more times than I've attempted it simply because I don't want to hurt anyone. But for me, when I do attempt it, it's because it's so dark, cold, lonely, desperate and incredibly painful that there seems no other way. Fifteen years I've been fighting it. I take tons of meds a day. And have therapies and a carer. In and out of psychiatric units for long periods. It is still incredibly lonely. I am alone with the pain. There may be people around me. But they don't know what's in my mind. 

There's a quote that says 'the bravest thing I ever did, was to continue living when all I wanted to do was die' 

When I am stable I believe that to be true. But when I'm not, and I attempt it, I think I am brave in doing so, because death is even terrifying for those who crave it. Because it is such an unknown end. 

When I am stable I say I live each day like it's my last, because I know it takes only seconds for me to spiral and hit rock bottom. 

I truly feel for him, his family and friends üòû so tragic. X",2017-05-18T21:39:42+0000

I don't wanna believe that he took his own life. I know he had a history of depression and battled drugs but dammit.... This news crushed me. My heart is heavy and my eyes keep watering. A part of me feels like I died. Soul crushing .... He impacted my life so much growing up. I followed him to anywhere he went- first time I heard his voice I fell in love. His voice went deep into my soul. Temple Of The Dog is the first time I heard his voice and I loved his vocals ever since. He is the same age as my two oldest brothers.

*Suicide Prevention*

Life's extremely tough waayyy more than any of the human minds think, but guys, you just simply have to face it, that's just life, and yeah, it freakin' sucks, but the only one inside of you that can battle it, is your courage and determination. And when it gets tough, study biology, because it could save your life (Emotionally). Now guys, at the end of the day, you can only prevent someone from taking their own lifes as much as you possibly can, but deep down, the only one who's going to have to toughen your heart up, is going to have to be yourself, because no one can see and feel it, but yourself. But just remember, people do truly care, when circumstances are real bad for you that no one could even imagine. But like the lifelines says guys, DON'T FIGHT IT ALONE! For people who are suffering this, I really wish for hope to come your way as fast as possible. Peace! ;)

I hope this has helped you, and gives you that little bit more power to get back up there, but if it hasn't helped, I'm truly sorry :( . I can only do so much out of my time to help others, Just like you of course. But guys, no matter how tough it gets, there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Remember that! 

But please guys, from my point of view, do not let suicide push you, you push ""IT"", Instead of it pushing you, and you know what pushes it away? Hope! :)",2017-05-20T01:38:21+0000

It formed a ring inside flesh,a liquid see thru would leak out touch my skin like acid. Screaming. Small hospital couldn't help. Just me and my doctor over 6 years, plus damage to spine 6 infiltrations every 4 months for excutiated pain, damage in knee/femur painful permanent, and maxillo facial surgery had to remove all teeth,gums,bones all broken. I'm housebound, if I fell I would get 70-100 lesions more. I had no support bc I told 2 friends, it was too much for them,and you shouldn't charge your sister that did that to you for 9 months. So I needed medicine. You get put down for that, finally a specialist called me upon reading my file this year and now my hemmoraging is stopping and I'm not leaking a lot of water from 5 spots on my bad leg. My 3 adult children visit a half hour 3x a year, no support. I don't bother all the groups I was involved in incl. School tutoring, churches etc.no calls from them.I wanted to die, I prayed I died bc I want to have a life. My husband just leaves bedroom door shut, and thinks I can still take care if a 12 1/2 room home. I was so close to my children, I feel I lost them and my man too. I not once had anyone take care of me I did it all myself. When I go to appointment I hide it all so no one knows. I don't want pity. Just a real friend that will hug me and believe in me that I'm trying so hard to get better, at least what I can. I would think that anyone would understand why I don't want to live plus I have 2 muscular diseases I was handling before this happened. I don't want pity just understanding. Its not CIG burns and I'm no druggie that's what the sm hospital said till they were told different. I apologize for the lengthy text..  I just want to be valued as a person. I have started therapy with a specialist in P.T.S.D.  etc.I don't show my family my burdens wrapped in bandages everyday.I understand why a person would want to die. But I have one thing I want to say to them. There's no one like you in this earth. Your valued and wanted bc you have talents,wisdom and knowledge only you can have no one else. If I can save one person from suicide then my life would be worth living. Thanks for listening",2017-05-08T08:59:59+0000

Many people are saying this series idealizes revenge and suicide, but I think it gives a very honest look (albeit dramatic) at what our kids are/do/see/feel and this honesty simply makes us uncomfortable.

And rarely is it about revenge and ""see what you did?"" Also, most people don't leave notes, let alone a series of video tapes. And it's never anyone's fault; it's the choice of person ending his/her life... though certainly survivors are left to grapple with the mystery. I'm glad there are more discussions about this important topic, but from what I read I think more accurate portrayals would further the cause better. People at risk may be triggered by the show or decided not to watch, which doesn't help them, and those who wanted to glimpse ""what it's like"" probably didn't see typical scenarios. But again, I didn't watch.",2017-05-04T00:10:50+0000

I went through my 15 year old cousins suicide in 2006 and the reasons behind it were done of the same reasons Hannah made the same choice. People need to understand that suicide is a problem in our country that can be fixed! And people who are considering suicide need to know how many people they could affect with their choice.. I attempted suicide 3 months after my cousin's and unfortunately her mother succeeded in her suicide 4 years after her daughter's..this is a reality many people face. I think this show has the potential to open alot of eyes and hopefully get parents involved in these hard conversations.,2017-05-03T16:10:04+0000

It was not only important that they showed the bully and those left behind but to focus on the people who did love her and we're to afraid to tell her.

I think it would have been great if it discussed mental illness because I do believe Hannah's character was suffering. I also hope that anyone who has or will watch knows, no single act of bullying or trauma should result in suicide, but we should be teaching others to go to someone higher up with these issues, I feel the tapes are excuses, suicide is an act one does by choice, in a moment of utter depression, when nothing else matters in that moment, being a mental health sufferer for many years and being in patient & out patient treatment for many years, I know this, we may not always be able to prevent certain things but how we react to them can be changed ..... so if you are being bullied, tell someone, if you are ever assaulted in any way, call the police, life is so precious and we need to be responsible for our own actions, and I don't agree that leaving tapes blaming others is right to portray because in the end, the choice was hers alone. I do hope it can help spread awareness because suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary issue, help is out there, people need to know, they are not alone!!!",2017-04-21T03:35:23+0000

I have gone through waves of ideation, and have been surviving depression since I was around the age of 12. This show makes a dramatization and almost a mockery of something serious. A show shouldn't teach you to be kind... People should have known that all along. Just for once can we have something that doesn't involve mental illness as a punchline? But then again, people have such short attention spans that anything dramatic and having shock value keeps their attention. It's sad but I guess if that's how people learn to be better human beings then so be it... 
I just know this show and the book can be very triggering to some, maybe not to all but to quite a few. 

For a show to completely disregard expert advice and explicitly display suicide just baffles me. It just angers me that it takes this to get people to talk.

By Lorena Cuevas 

  All of my favorite flowers grow on trees.  Cherry, plum, fuchsia, and magnolia. I think that not to be a coincidence. One should aspire to be a tree blossom. All come and goes with the season. Beautiful, growing high. They always have hope that tomorrow will be better. Living their whole life knowing that although their are beautiful, that beauty is fickle and fleeting. Beauty which does not last. Like those trees which surround changes with the season. Once colorful and fragrant, one day it could all dissipate, yet still you bloom. 
  Although delicate they are resistant to bad weather. As these flowers, you do not know when the storm is coming. You, yet still survive the bad weather. Every year you try again as if though you forgot about what happened in the last season.  
  Sometimes people will come and spray poison all around you. This poison not only surrounds you but covers you. You yet still, survive the poison. You are surrounded by flowers that are going through the same weather,poison, and uncertainty as you.
   Be a perennial, lasting for a long infinite time. Please do not  forget the flowers that grow on trees can sometimes bear fruit. Never give up on the hope that your efforts will be fruitful. There are festivals all around the world that look forward to a new years blossom. Every year everyone looks foward to your blooms. Please never stop trying to make the world stop for one moment and antisipate you;",2017-04-13T04:59:33+0000
